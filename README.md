LEAF is a C++11 error handling library capable of transporting arbitrary error information from contexts that detect and report failures, as well as from intermediate error-neutral contexts, to scopes where the error is handled.

LEAF does not allocate memory dynamically, which makes it suitable for low-latency and other performance-critical environments. It is equally applicable to programs that use exception handling and programs that do not.
